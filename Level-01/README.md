# Level 1: Hello, World! üåç

## Objectives
- Create a Swift Playground to display a simple message in the console.
- Learn to use the `print()` function for text and basic arithmetic output.
- Get familiar with Xcode Playground for quick, interactive code testing.

## Project Setup
- Created a Blank Playground in Xcode named `level_01.playground`.
- No imports needed for this level.
- Results displayed live in the Playground‚Äôs right-side output panel.

## Highlights
- Discovered that `print()` automatically adds a newline (`\n`), simplifying multi-line outputs.
- Playgrounds provide instant feedback, perfect for beginners to experiment without compiling.
- Successfully computed a basic arithmetic expression (2 + 2) directly in `print()`.

## Lessons Learned
- Swift syntax is clean: no semicolons needed, strings use double quotes.
- Fixed an issue where outputs appeared on one line due to `terminator: ""` ‚Äì learned the default newline behavior.
- Challenge: Realized `print()` can handle numbers directly, opening doors for future calculations.

## Bonus Challenge Completed
- Opted for a simple calculation (2 + 2) to display "4", as date formatting was too advanced for this level.
- Introduced evaluating expressions without variables, preparing for Level 2.
