# 🚀 Swift Developer Journey — 100 Levels Challenge

Welcome! I'm **Hugo**, a total beginner in programming, embarking on a quest to master Swift and SwiftUI, one level at a time.

Like in a video game, I'll progress through 100 projects of increasing difficulty, building solid skills from zero to professional expertise.

I'll document my code, share lessons learned, and create a public portfolio that illustrates my growth. Each project will be self-contained, testable, and well-commented so others can learn alongside me.

Let the adventure begin! 🚀

---

## 📋 Prerequisites to Get Started

- A Mac with **Xcode** installed (free from App Store; latest version recommended – check swift.org).
- No prior knowledge needed! We're starting from zero.
- Optional: Git and a GitHub account for versioning.
- Resources: Apple docs (developer.apple.com), Hacking with Swift tutorials, Xcode Playgrounds...

---

## 🧱 Repo Structure

This is a **single monorepo** for simplicity:

- 📂 **Level Folders** (e.g., `Level-01/`): Each contains source code, inline comments, a local README.md (objectives, highlights, lessons), and assets like screenshots.
- 🚀 **Root Files**: This README.md as the hub, plus shared utilities (e.g., .gitignore).

Easy to navigate, fork, and search across levels!

## 🔥 Why This Challenge?

1. **Solid Foundations**  
   Master every core Swift concept, from basic syntax to advanced frameworks like SwiftUI and Combine.
   
2. **Growth Mindset**  
   Tackle varied projects that challenge problem-solving, iterating like a pro dev (debug, refactor, test).

3. **Visible Progress**  
   Build a public portfolio with source code, reflections, and evolutions – ideal for a resume or community.

4. **Consistent Discipline**  
   Maintain motivation via a clear goal: one level = one completed, documented, and validated project.

## 💡 Roadmap & Milestones
Here's a high-level overview of the phases:

1. **Levels 1–20: Syntax Basics**  
   Focus on syntax, data structures, and console algorithms.

2. **Levels 21–40: SwiftUI Fundamentals**  
   Focus on views, navigation, and state management.

3. **Levels 41–60: Data & Persistence**  
   Focus on networking, JSON parsing, and local storage.

4. **Levels 61–80: Advanced & Architecture**  
   Focus on Combine, unit testing, and MVVM architecture.

5. **Levels 81–100: Real Projects & Deployment**  
   Focus on games, authentication, and App Store release.

- **Pro Tips:** Don't skip levels – basics help debug later. For each project, add "bonus challenges" (e.g., optimize for performance). Use async/await everywhere for modern code.
