# Level 2: Variables & Constants ðŸ“¦

## Objectives
- Declare and use variables (`var`) and constants (`let`) to store data.
- Combine values dynamically using string interpolation (`\(...)`).
- Understand mutability: when to use immutable vs mutable values.

## Project Setup
- Created a Blank Playground in Xcode named `level_02.playground`.
- No imports required.
- Results displayed live in the Playgroundâ€™s output panel.

## Highlights
- Used `let` for immutable values (name, goal) and `var` for mutable (age), aligning with Swift's safety focus.
- String interpolation made messages dynamic and reusable without repetition.
- Computed future age directly in print, showing basic arithmetic with variables.

## Lessons Learned
- Naming conventions: Start with lowercase (camelCase) for vars/constants to follow Apple guidelines.
- Type inference: Swift automatically detects types (String, Int), but explicit types help for clarity.
- Learned interpolation handles expressions like \(age + 1).
- Prefer `let` over `var` for immutability â€“ reduces bugs in larger apps.
